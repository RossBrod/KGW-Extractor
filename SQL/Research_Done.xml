			<LP#1>Witness Protection Principle. FEHA protects employees who participate in workplace discrimination investigations.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Gov. Code § 12940(h); Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 36 Cal.4th 1028 (2005)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Anti-Discrimination -> Retaliation Protection</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>Yanowitz established that California's FEHA broadly protects employees who oppose discrimination, including those who participate in investigations as witnesses.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>FEHA prohibits retaliation against employees who oppose unlawful practices or participate in investigations, regardless of whether the underlying claim succeeds.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Jordan's act of corroborating Alex's harassment claims during an HR investigation constitutes protected activity under FEHA, establishing the first element of a retaliation claim regardless of the outcome of Alex's original complaint.</AppliedArgument>

    Prima Facie Retaliation Standard. Three-part test establishes presumption of retaliation.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Joaquin v. City of Los Angeles, 202 Cal.App.4th 1207 (2012)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Retaliation -> Evidentiary Standards</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>Joaquin outlines the elements needed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under California law.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Plaintiff must show: (1) protected activity, (2) adverse employment action, and (3) causal link between protected activity and adverse action.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Jordan can establish all three elements: corroborating testimony (protected activity), negative reviews and termination (adverse actions), and close temporal proximity with supporting evidence from VP's statement (causal link).</AppliedArgument>

    Substantial Motivating Factor Test. Retaliation need not be sole reason.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Harris v. City of Santa Monica, 56 Cal.4th 203 (2013)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Discrimination -> Causation Standard</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>Harris established the "substantial motivating factor" standard for discrimination cases under FEHA, which courts have applied to retaliation claims as well.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Plaintiff must prove protected activity was a substantial motivating factor, not necessarily the only factor.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Jordan need not prove retaliation was the only reason for termination; showing it was a substantial motivating factor is sufficient, even if Vertex claims restructuring was also a factor.</AppliedArgument>

    Post-Employment Protection Principle. Former employees protected from retaliation.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997); Hashimoto v. Dalton, 118 F.3d 671 (9th Cir. 1997)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Retaliation -> Post-Employment Protection</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>Robinson (federal case) established that Title VII protects former employees from retaliation. Hashimoto applied this principle in the Ninth Circuit (covering California).</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Anti-retaliation provisions protect former employees from post-employment retaliatory actions.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Jordan remains protected from Vertex's retaliatory actions even after termination, including negative references and "not eligible for rehire" designations that impact future employment.</AppliedArgument>
					</CaseCication>

    Negative Reference Protection. Negative references can constitute retaliation.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Pantoja v. Anton, 198 Cal.App.4th 87 (2011); Cagnina v. United Parcel Service, 2016 WL 4203530 (N.D. Cal. 2016)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Retaliation -> Negative References</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These cases address post-employment actions that can constitute retaliation, including providing negative information to prospective employers.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Negative references or information affecting employability can constitute unlawful retaliation if motivated by protected activity.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Vertex's "not eligible for rehire" designation, while providing "neutral references," may constitute continuing retaliation if motivated by Jordan's participation in the discrimination investigation.</AppliedArgument>

    Continuing Violation Doctrine. Ongoing retaliatory acts may extend statute.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Richards v. CH2M Hill, Inc., 26 Cal.4th 798 (2001); Morgan v. Regents of University of California, 88 Cal.App.4th 52 (2000)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Procedural Issues -> Statute of Limitations</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These cases establish that continuing violations may extend the statute of limitations for filing claims.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Repeated or ongoing retaliatory acts may be treated as continuing violations for limitations purposes.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Each instance where Vertex provides negative information to prospective employers may constitute a new act of retaliation, potentially extending the time period for Jordan to file a claim.</AppliedArgument>

    Temporal Proximity Inference. Close timing creates presumption of causation.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Loggins v. Kaiser Permanente Int'l, 151 Cal.App.4th 1102 (2007); Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, 214 Cal.App.3d 590 (1989)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Retaliation -> Causation Evidence</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These cases establish that temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse action can create an inference of causation.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Close timing between protected activity and adverse action supports inference of retaliatory motive.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>The short time between Jordan's testimony and the sudden negative reviews, project exclusion, and eventual termination strongly supports an inference of retaliatory motivation.</AppliedArgument>

    Performance Review Pretext Analysis. Sudden negative reviews suggest pretext.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Nazir v. United Airlines, Inc., 178 Cal.App.4th 243 (2009); Flait v. North American Watch Corp., 3 Cal.App.4th 467 (1992)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Retaliation -> Pretext Evidence</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These cases address sudden negative performance evaluations following protected activity as evidence of pretext.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Dramatic shift in performance evaluations after protected activity suggests pretext for retaliation.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Jordan's previously positive performance reviews suddenly becoming negative after participating in the discrimination investigation strongly suggests these reviews were pretextual justifications for retaliatory actions.</AppliedArgument>

    Cat's Paw Liability. Supervisor's retaliatory intent influences decision.
    <CasesCited>

      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Retaliation -> Supervisory Liability</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These cases establish that a supervisor's retaliatory animus can create employer liability even if the final decision-maker lacked retaliatory intent.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Employer liable when biased supervisor's actions influence adverse employment decisions.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>The VP's statement about "people who air dirty laundry" suggests retaliatory animus that likely influenced the decision to terminate Jordan, even if formally characterized as "restructuring."</AppliedArgument>

		<issue>Remedies Available under FEHA vs. Title VII</issue>
		<LegalPrinciplesList>
			<LP#1>
    FEHA Remedial Advantages. FEHA offers broader remedies.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Gov. Code § 12965(b); Commodore Home Systems, Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal.3d 211 (1982)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Remedies -> Damages Availability</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These authorities establish the range of remedies available under FEHA, which are more expansive than Title VII.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>FEHA provides uncapped compensatory and punitive damages for retaliation.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Jordan should pursue claims under both Title VII and FEHA, but FEHA's unlimited damages make it particularly advantageous for seeking full compensation for economic and emotional harm.</AppliedArgument>

    Title VII Damage Caps. Federal law limits monetary damages.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>42 U.S.C. § 1981a(b)(3); Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 532 U.S. 843 (2001)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Remedies -> Statutory Limitations</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These authorities establish the caps on compensatory and punitive damages under Title VII.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Title VII caps combined compensatory and punitive damages based on employer size.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>While Jordan should include Title VII claims, the statutory caps (ranging from $50,000 to $300,000 depending on Vertex's size) may limit recovery compared to uncapped FEHA damages.</AppliedArgument>

    Statute of Limitations Differences. Different filing deadlines apply.
    <CasesCited>

      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Procedural Issues -> Filing Deadlines</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These statutes establish the deadlines for filing administrative complaints, which are prerequisites to lawsuits.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>FEHA: 3 years to file with DFEH; Title VII: 300 days to file with EEOC.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>Jordan has significantly more time to file under California's FEHA (3 years) compared to Title VII (300 days), providing important procedural advantages for pursuing state claims.</AppliedArgument>

    Attorney's Fees Recovery. Prevailing parties may recover fees.
    <CasesCited>
					<CaseCication>Gov. Code § 12965(b) (FEHA); Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978) (Title VII)
      <LawDomain>Employment Law -> Remedies -> Attorney's Fees</LawDomain>
						<WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>These authorities address recovery of attorney's fees by prevailing parties in discrimination and retaliation cases.</WhyCaseIsThisRelevant>
						<CaseEstablishesRule>Both FEHA and Title VII allow prevailing plaintiffs to recover reasonable attorney's fees.</CaseEstablishesRule>
						<AppliedArgument>If successful, Jordan can seek recovery of attorney's fees under both statutes, significantly enhancing the total potential recovery and making the case more financially viable to pursue.</AppliedArgument>
