    <LegalDomain>
        Employment Law -> Wage and Hour Laws -> Minimum Wage Requirements
    </LegalDomain>

    <MainCausesOfAction>
        - Failure to pay minimum wages for time spent in initial training (FLSA and California Labor Code)
        - Failure to reimburse expenses incurred by Sales Representatives (California Labor Code)
        - Violation of California's Unfair Competition Law based on the coerced purchase of sample knife sets during training
    </MainCausesOfAction>

    <KeyHoldingsAndLegalPrinciples>
        <Holdings>
            - The court granted final certification of the FLSA collective action for all individuals who worked as Vector Sales Representatives in California from April 15, 2006 through May 12, 2010.
            - The court granted class certification under Rule 23 for the state law claims related to the initial training period, but denied certification for the post-training expense reimbursement claim.
        </Holdings>
        <LegalPrinciples>
            - The court applied the DOL/Portland Terminal test to determine whether the trainees should be considered "employees" entitled to minimum wage, rather than the more stringent Borello test used for independent contractors.
            - The court found that the DOL/Portland Terminal factors could largely be evaluated on a collective basis, establishing sufficient commonality and predominance for class certification.
            - The court rejected the defendant's argument that FLSA certification should preclude Rule 23 class certification of the state law claims.
        </LegalPrinciples>
    </KeyHoldingsAndLegalPrinciples>

    <BothSidesArgumentsAndReasoning>
        <PlaintiffArguments>
            - The trainees should be considered "employees" entitled to minimum wage under the DOL/Portland Terminal test.
            - There is sufficient commonality and predominance of common issues to warrant class certification of the state law claims related to the training period.
        </PlaintiffArguments>
        <DefendantArguments>
            - The trainees should be considered independent contractors not entitled to minimum wage, and the Borello test should apply.
            - FLSA certification should preclude Rule 23 class certification of the state law claims.
            - There are individualized issues that defeat predominance and manageability for the post-training expense reimbursement claim.
        </DefendantArguments>
    </BothSidesArgumentsAndReasoning>
    <ApplicabilityOfTheCase>
        This case would be cited in cases involving minimum wage requirements and employee classification under the FLSA and state labor laws.
    </ApplicabilityOfTheCase>
    <CourtsReasoning>
        The court found that the DOL/Portland Terminal test was the appropriate framework for evaluating whether the trainees were "employees" entitled to minimum wage, as it was better suited to the training context than the Borello test for independent contractors. The court determined that the DOL/Portland Terminal factors could largely be evaluated on a collective basis, establishing the requirements for FLSA collective action and Rule 23 class certification of the related state law claims.
    </CourtsReasoning>
    <Rationale>
        The court's findings favored the plaintiff because the court concluded that the trainees were sufficiently "similarly situated" to warrant collective treatment under the FLSA, and that common issues predominated for the state law claims related to the training period, warranting class certification.
