Here is a hypothetical scenario based on the legal principles from this case:

<hs1>
I had just graduated high school and was looking for a summer job before starting college in the fall. I saw an ad for a sales position with Acme Cutlery Company that promised great pay and flexible hours. I applied and was invited to attend a three-day training program. 

During the training, we were told we had to purchase our own sample knife set for $300 in order to do demonstrations. We weren't paid for our time in training, but were assured we'd make great commissions once we started selling. We also had to create lists of potential customers and start setting up appointments during the training.

After completing the training, I signed an agreement to be an "independent sales representative" for Acme. I was given a territory to sell in, but had to use my own car and cell phone. I was told I had to check in with my manager daily and follow a specific sales script during presentations. 

For the next two months, I worked long hours trying to make sales, but barely broke even after accounting for my expenses. I felt like I was being treated as an employee, not an independent contractor. When I complained, my manager threatened to terminate my contract.

Now I'm wondering if I should have been paid minimum wage for the training time and reimbursed for my expenses. I've heard other Acme reps have similar complaints. I'm considering joining a class action lawsuit against the company to recover unpaid wages and expenses.
