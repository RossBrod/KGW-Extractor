4. Public Policy Benefiting the Public: The public policy violated by the termination must be one that benefits the public at large, not just the private interests of the employer or employee.

5. Causal Nexus for Wrongful Termination: The employee must establish a causal nexus between the protected activity and the employer's adverse employment action, such that the protected activity was a but-for cause of the termination.

6. Employer Privilege for Termination Disclosures: An employer has a qualified privilege under California law to communicate information about an employee's termination to other employees who have a common interest in the subject matter, as long as the communication is made without malice.
