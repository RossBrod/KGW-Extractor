Based on the case law provided, I have identified the following causes of action used in this case:

<CYPHER>
CREATE (coa_wrongfulTermination:CauseOfAction {
  name: "Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy",
  type: "Tort",
  description: "Plaintiff was terminated in violation of a fundamental public policy"
})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_wrongfulTermination)

CREATE (coa_breachContract:CauseOfAction {
  name: "Breach of Express and Implied-in-Fact Contracts not to Terminate Without Good Cause",
  type: "Breach of Contract",
  description: "Plaintiff's employment was wrongfully terminated despite an implied or express contract requiring good cause for termination"
})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_breachContract)

CREATE (coa_defamation:CauseOfAction {
  name: "Defamation and Compelled Self-Defamation",
  type: "Defamation",
  description: "Defendant falsely informed others that Plaintiff was terminated for threatening a co-worker, and Plaintiff was forced to republish these defamatory statements"
})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_defamation)
</CYPHER>

The key causes of action in this case are:

1. Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy
   - Plaintiff claims he was terminated for reporting alleged illegal activity by a co-worker, which violated a fundamental public policy.

2. Breach of Express and Implied-in-Fact Contracts not to Terminate Without Good Cause
   - Plaintiff claims his employment was wrongfully terminated despite an implied or express contract requiring good cause for termination.

3. Defamation and Compelled Self-Defamation
   - Plaintiff claims Defendant falsely informed others that he was terminated for threatening a co-worker, and he was forced to republish these defamatory statements.

The court analyzed each of these causes of action in detail and ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant on all three claims.
