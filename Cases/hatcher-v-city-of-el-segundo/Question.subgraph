I am Sarah Chen, a 52-year-old senior software engineer at TechCorp, where I've worked for the past 15 years. Over the past two years, my work environment has become increasingly difficult. After recovering from carpal tunnel surgery in 2022, I returned to work with medical restrictions on typing time. Initially, my manager Jim refused to provide any accommodations, saying "We don't do light duty here." After I involved HR, I was allowed to return part-time with reduced coding duties.

However, since then, Jim has repeatedly made comments about retirement, asking me at least twice a month when I plan to "hang up my keyboard." He's made remarks like "coding is a young person's game" and "don't you want to enjoy life while you still can?" Other team members have started making similar comments.

More concerning is that my workload has dramatically increased. While other senior engineers typically handle 3-4 major projects at a time, I've been assigned 6-7 projects simultaneously for the past year. When I raised concerns about the excessive workload, Jim dismissed them, saying I should be able to handle it. However, due to ongoing technical issues with our development environment, I've actually completed fewer projects than assigned.

The constant pressure about retirement combined with what feels like an impossible workload has created an extremely stressful situation. Although I've received positive performance reviews and have no restrictions on my work activities now, I'm considering resigning since the environment has become so difficult to endure. I believe TechCorp is trying to push me out due to my age and past medical accommodations by creating these intolerable working conditions.
