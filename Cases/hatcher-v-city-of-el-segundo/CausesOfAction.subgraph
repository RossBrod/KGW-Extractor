Here is the Cypher code to create the nodes and relationships for the causes of action in the given case law:

<CYPHER>
CREATE (coa_constructivedischarge:CauseOfAction {name: "Constructive Discharge", type: "Discrimination", description: "Hatcher was constructively discharged due to intolerable working conditions"})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_constructivedischarge)

CREATE (coa_failureaccommodate:CauseOfAction {name: "Failure to Accommodate", type: "Disability", description: "City failed to reasonably accommodate Hatcher's known physical disability"})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_failureaccommodate)

CREATE (lb_feha:LegalBasis {name: "California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA)", type: "Statute", description: "Prohibits employment discrimination based on disability and age"})
MERGE (coa_constructivedischarge)-[:BASED_ON]->(lb_feha)
MERGE (coa_failureaccommodate)-[:BASED_ON]->(lb_feha)
</CYPHER>

The key causes of action in this case are:

1. Constructive Discharge
   - Type: Discrimination
   - Description: Hatcher was constructively discharged due to intolerable working conditions

2. Failure to Accommodate 
   - Type: Disability
   - Description: City failed to reasonably accommodate Hatcher's known physical disability

Both of these causes of action are based on the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).
