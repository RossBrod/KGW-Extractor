 No. 82 C 7299. 

 March 2, 1984. 

 Gregory A. Stayart, Sullivan Associates, Ltd., Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff. 

 Catherine E. Tinker, Conklin Adler, Ltd., Chicago, Ill., for defendants. 


 Harold Haupt ("Haupt") originally sued International Harvester Company ("IH," his former employer) and Michael McGrath ("McGrath," his former supervisor) in connection with Haupt's discharge from IH's employment. This Court's earlier opinion, 571 F. Supp. 1043 ( https://casetext.com/case/haupt-v-international-harvester-co ) (N.D.Ill. 1983) dismissed IH as a defendant for Haupt's failure to sue within the limitations period of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 621-634 ( https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-29-labor/chapter-14-age-discrimination-in-employment/section-621-congressional-statement-of-findings-and-purpose ) . That left pending a single state-law count against McGrath, charging tortious interference with Haupt's employment contract.

 Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. § 1332 ( https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-28-judiciary-and-judicial-procedure/part-iv-jurisdiction-and-venue/chapter-85-district-courts-jurisdiction/section-1332-diversity-of-citizenship-amount-in-controversy-costs ) .

 McGrath now moves for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. ("Rule") 56, arguing: 

 

 McGrath has also moved to strike much of Haupt's evidence for failure to comply with Rule 56's evidentiary standards. McGrath's motion to strike is well taken in part, but his summary judgment motion is denied. 

 

 This statement implies no ultimate findings, but rather results from drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Haupt, the nonmoving party. See Korf v. Ball State University, 726 F.2d 1222, 1226 ( https://casetext.com/case/korf-v-ball-state-university#p1226 ) (7th Cir. 1984). As the later text discussion reflects, however, not all Haupt's tendered evidence has been taken into account.

 IH employed Haupt from October 1964 to November 1980. Beginning in January 1974 Haupt was "pallet pool coordinator" in a two-person department. He monitored the quality of pallet and container parts used in IH's operations and contracted with various suppliers for IH's requirements of those items. McGrath became Haupt's supervisor in October 1977. At McGrath's request Haupt added Jackson, Inc., which later became Buckeye Wood Products (for convenience simply "Buckeye"), as a pallet supplier. McGrath increased Buckeye's share of IH's pallet business until April 1980, when he authorized Buckeye to communicate directly with IH's material suppliers to fulfill their pallet needs. Buckeye's increasing importance as a pallet supplier, and Haupt's complaints about its performance, led to disputes between Haupt and McGrath. 

 Haupt contends McGrath intentionally and maliciously caused Haupt's discharge to preserve McGrath's improper favoritism toward Buckeye. In support of that view Haupt presents evidence showing: 

 

 McGrath does not deny (as he cannot, given the operative principles under Rule 56) the reasonable inference he desired Haupt's discharge as part of McGrath's coverup of his relationship with Buckeye. Instead he contends the actual reason Haupt was laid off was IH's deteriorating financial condition. See Lawrence Siebers Aff.; Andrews Dec. 2, 1983 Aff.; Gigliotti Dec. 2, 1983 Aff. 

 Haupt's evidentiary presentation consists of his own lengthy affidavit (with 21 exhibits) plus three short affidavits by IH employees disclaiming knowledge of McGrath's motivation. During the course of the summary judgment proceedings McGrath moved to strike Haupt's affidavit and its exhibits in their entirety. Of the 100 paragraphs in Haupt's affidavit, McGrath contends: ( https://casetext.com/case/haupt-v-international-harvester-co-2#7fbd6f69-8ac6-4b07-bd68-e7a92aff0ae7-fn3 ) 

 Of course some paragraphs are vulnerable to more than one of McGrath's attacks.

 McGrath's argument none of the exhibits can be admitted into evidence because they are unsworn and uncertified has no merit, because Haupt's affidavit itself is sworn to. As our Court of Appeals stated in First Nat'l Bank Co. of Clinton v. Ins. Co. of North America, 606 F.2d 760, 766 ( https://casetext.com/case/first-nat-bank-co-etc-v-insurance-co#p766 ) (7th Cir. 1979) (citations omitted): 

 3. Twelve paragraphs contain inadmissible hearsay. 

 4. Five paragraphs are irrelevant. 

 Because Haupt relies almost entirely on his own affidavit, granting McGrath's motion to strike would eviscerate Haupt's position. Nonetheless such action is warranted when "inadmissible matter is so interwoven or inextricably combined with the admissible portions that it is impossible, in the practical sense, to separate them" ( Southern Concrete Co. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 F. Supp. 362, 381 ( https://casetext.com/case/southern-concrete-co-v-united-states-steel-corp#p381 ) (N.D.Ga. 1975)). 

 There are indeed serious problems with the admissibility of much of the material in Haupt's affidavit. It is arranged as a narrative in which Haupt explains the facts of his case and the manner in which they came to his attention. ( https://casetext.com/case/haupt-v-international-harvester-co-2#36a6d995-c455-44bc-8c84-58d263e66dd6-fn5 ) Except for the three short affidavits, no attempt has been made to present testimony obtained directly from Haupt's sources. Moreover the narrative is never interrupted to provide a foundation for, ( https://casetext.com/case/haupt-v-international-harvester-co-2#45416e43-01c7-41e9-8502-e45b6cd66e79-fn6 ) or even describe, the attached exhibits. Instead the word "Appendix" and some identifying letter are placed in parentheses at various points in the affidavit, and the reader is required to infer from the context of the parentheses the nature and predicate for admissibility of the referenced exhibit. 

 This is not to say Haupt has provided a Joycean stream-of-consciousness narrative. His presentation is both orderly and readily understandable.

 In one obviously improper attempt at self-authentication of a document, Haupt Aff. ¶ 98 offers a memo by an IH manager into evidence solely on the assertion Haupt obtained it from his own attorney in the course of this litigation.

 Two factors however counsel against striking Haupt's affidavit in its entirety: 

 

 Thus it is necessary to consider each of McGrath's objections individually. 

 This Court has done so. There is no need to rule specifically on each objection, for this opinion's earlier statement of facts did not rely on any evidence this Court has found inadmissible, and that residuum of facts is sufficient to preclude summary judgment for McGrath. It is true Haupt has no personal knowledge of the reasons for McGrath's resignation, and thus no evidence in Haupt's affidavit on that subject would survive the motion to strike. Nonetheless the belatedly filed Gigliotti affidavit suffices for that purpose. 

 Illinois law has long recognized not only the conventional tort of interference with contract rights but the related tort (with less stringent proof requirements) usually labeled interference with advantageous relationships or with business relationships or expectancies. City of Rock Falls v. Chicago Title Trust Co., 13 Ill. App.3d 359, 363 ( https://casetext.com/case/city-of-rock-falls-v-chicago-title-trust#p363 ) , 300 N.E.2d 331, 333 ( https://casetext.com/case/city-of-rock-falls-v-chicago-title-trust#p333 ) (3d Dist. 1973) listed the four elements required under Illinois law to state a cause of action for such intentional interference with "the reasonable expectation of economic advantage": 

 

 Haupt of course prefers to ignore that more expansive tort, concentrating on the inducing-breach-of-contract theory alone. For the first part of his summary judgment argument McGrath thus contends Haupt cannot establish either the first or the third stated element in contract terms. As the following discussion reflects, that contention is built on a quicksand base and must collapse. 

 As to the first element, the existence of a valid business relationship, McGrath points out Haupt was an at-will IH employee without a written employment contract. McGrath then argues an at-will employment relationship cannot be tortiously interfered with because it was not enforceable in the first instance. ( https://casetext.com/case/haupt-v-international-harvester-co-2#55e4cff7-4d9e-4542-93da-6d419126b6af-fn7 ) 

 McGrath also argues Haupt's employment contract is unenforceable as violative of the Statute of Frauds because it cannot be performed within one year. If that argument were relevant (as it is not) it would obviously be inconsistent with Haupt's conceded at-will employment status. Because either party could terminate Haupt's employment contract without liability for breach, that contract of course is capable of being performed within one year.

 Of course City of Rock Falls reveals the flaw in McGrath's analysis: Enforceability of the underlying contract is not required. TAD, Inc. v. Siebert, 63 Ill. App.3d 1001, 1006 ( https://casetext.com/case/tad-inc-v-siebert#p1006 ) , 20 Ill.Dec. 754, 758 ( https://casetext.com/case/tad-inc-v-siebert#p758 ) , 380 N.E.2d 963, 967 ( https://casetext.com/case/tad-inc-v-siebert#p967 ) (1st Dist. 1978) ( https://casetext.com/case/haupt-v-international-harvester-co-2#a34be112-1713-4d33-958b-4c1239e3744c-fn8 ) reinforces the proposition: 

 Under familiar Erie v. Tompkins principles, cases from Illinois' First Appellate District would control here on any issues to which the Illinois Supreme Court has not addressed itself and as to which there is a divergence of views among the Appellate Districts. Abbott Laboratories v. Granite State Ins. Co., 573 F. Supp. 193, 195 ( https://casetext.com/case/abbott-laboratories-v-granite-state-ins-co#p195 ) (N.D.Ill. 1983).

 

 Thus Haupt's at-will employment status does not immunize McGrath from liability. ( https://casetext.com/case/haupt-v-international-harvester-co-2#6d69f22a-e38e-4524-87d3-9d732c7a6386-fn9 ) McGrath seizes upon the "willingness to continue" requirement of TAD and argues IH was unwilling to continue Haupt's employment due to its financial condition. That contention however is really just an aspect of the requirement that a defendant must have caused the termination of the relationship to be held liable for tortious interference. 

 Pfendler v. Anshe Emet Day School, 81 Ill. App.3d 818, 825 ( https://casetext.com/case/pfendler-v-anshe-emet-day-school#p825 ) , 37 Ill.Dec. 1, 4 ( https://casetext.com/case/pfendler-v-anshe-emet-day-school#p4 ) , 401 N.E.2d 1094, 1098 ( https://casetext.com/case/pfendler-v-anshe-emet-day-school#p1098 ) (1st Dist. 1980) and Titchener v. Avery Coonley School, 39 Ill. App.3d 871, 876 ( https://casetext.com/case/titchener-v-avery-coonley-school#p876 ) , 350 N.E.2d 502, 507 ( https://casetext.com/case/titchener-v-avery-coonley-school#p507 ) (2d Dist. 1976) say there is no cause of action for interference with contract where there is no liability for breach of contract. But in both cases the plaintiff could not show any reasonable expectancy of continued employment except by pointing to the enforceability of the terminated contract. Titchener distinguished cases in which plaintiff relied on an expectancy other than an enforceable contract ( 39 Ill.App.3d at 876 ( https://casetext.com/case/titchener-v-avery-coonley-school#p876 ) , 350 N.E.2d at 507-08 ( https://casetext.com/case/titchener-v-avery-coonley-school#p507 ) , citations omitted): 

 As for the third element of causation, McGrath contends he did not cause Haupt's termination because Haupt would have been terminated in any event. In support McGrath establishes IH's management approved Haupt's termination as a cost-saving action at a time when reduction of costs was imperative to IH. But that lone fact does not rise to the level of but-for causation. It can reasonably be inferred from Haupt's presentation that he would not have been fired but for McGrath's actions. 

 After all, McGrath's presentation on this point applies no more to Haupt than to any other IH employee. Many but by no means all IH employees have been laid off for economic reasons. Thus a showing that economic factors applied to Haupt's resignation does not even approach what is needed to preclude any reasonable inference that McGrath caused Haupt's layoff. 

 Illinois courts consider privilege a defense to tortious interference, and not an element whose absence must be pleaded (or, more importantly, proved) by plaintiff. Kemper, 106 Ill.App.3d at 125 ( https://casetext.com/case/kemper-v-worcester#p125 ) , 62 Ill.Dec. at 32 ( https://casetext.com/case/kemper-v-worcester#p32 ) , 435 N.E.2d at 830 ( https://casetext.com/case/kemper-v-worcester#p830 ) . For the second prong of his summary judgment attack McGrath argues he has established as a matter of law a privilege to act as he did toward Haupt. Obviously McGrath as Haupt's supervisor had greater freedom to interfere with Haupt's employment than a person who did not stand in such a relationship with Haupt and IH. Equally obviously that freedom was not absolute. Illinois adheres to the doctrine, also found in defamation law, that any privilege conferred by a valid business interest is conditional in nature and is divested by a showing of "actual malice." Arlington Heights National Bank v. Arlington Heights Savings Loan Association, 37 Ill.2d 546, 551 ( https://casetext.com/case/arlington-hgts-nat-bk-v-arl-hgts-sav#p551 ) , 229 N.E.2d 514, 518 ( https://casetext.com/case/arlington-hgts-nat-bk-v-arl-hgts-sav#p518 ) (1967); see also Zeinfeld v. Hayes Freight Lines, 41 Ill.2d 345, 349 ( https://casetext.com/case/zeinfeld-v-hayes-freight-lines-inc#p349 ) , 243 N.E.2d 217, 221 ( https://casetext.com/case/zeinfeld-v-hayes-freight-lines-inc#p221 ) (1968) (defamation case). 

 McGrath claims divestiture of his conditional privilege is impossible here because Haupt's discharge was in the best interest of IH and McGrath truthfully reported that fact. Accordingly he posits no investigation of his subjective good faith is necessary or even relevant. McGrath's strongest supporting authority is IV Restatement [First] of Torts § 772 comment a, at 86 (1939), which discusses the scope of the privilege when advice is requested, the advice rendered is within the scope of the request and the advice is honest: 

 

 See also the nearly identical language in 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts § 772 comment c, at 50-51 (1979). Bentley v. Teton, 19 Ill. App.2d 284, 289 ( https://casetext.com/case/bentley-v-teton#p289 ) , 153 N.E.2d 495, 498 ( https://casetext.com/case/bentley-v-teton#p498 ) (1st Dist. 1958) and Feeley v. McAuliffe, 335 Ill. App. 99, 103 ( https://casetext.com/case/feeley-v-mcauliffe#p103 ) , 80 N.E.2d 373, 375-76 ( https://casetext.com/case/feeley-v-mcauliffe#p375 ) (1st Dist. 1948) implicitly adopted that position, holding a defendant's hostility alone does not require liability for tortious interference with contract if the defendant had acted pursuant to a legitimate right to act. 

 Three problems with McGrath's position compel this Court to reject it: 

 

 Although McGrath cites only the original version of the Restatement, Restatement (Second) § 772 actually improves his argument somewhat by giving a pass to "truthful information" as well as "honest advice." That however makes no difference here. First, even were McGrath's information to IH management viewed as "truthful," the next two numbered paragraphs in the text of this opinion would still apply to preserve Haupt's action. Second, where the informing party's motive is as illegitimate and personal as that ascribed to McGrath, this Court would not view as "truthful" a communication that did not inform the decision-maker at IH of all the facts relevant to his or her decision (including McGrath's motive in seeking to torpedo Haupt) — much like the material omission concept under the securities laws.

 Thus various disputed issues of material fact remain on the issue of whether McGrath's actions were privileged. Most notably, the materiality of McGrath's state of mind precludes summary judgment under the circumstances here. Thornton v. Evans, 692 F.2d 1064, 1075 ( https://casetext.com/case/thornton-v-evans-3#p1075 ) (7th Cir. 1982). 

 Even ignoring the portions of Haupt's tendered evidence omitted from the "Facts" section of this opinion, Haupt has demonstrated the existence of disputed issues of material fact. McGrath's motion for summary judgment is denied.
