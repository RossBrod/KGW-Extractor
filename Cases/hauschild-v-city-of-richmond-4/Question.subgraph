I am a high school teacher who witnessed concerning behavior from our school principal during an investigation into racial discrimination complaints. Here's what happened:

I was called into the principal's office to discuss complaints from several minority students about unfair treatment in our school's advanced placement program. The principal asked me to provide a statement blaming the low enrollment numbers of minority students on our African-American AP coordinator, suggesting she wasn't doing enough outreach. I knew this wasn't true - the coordinator had actually implemented several innovative recruitment initiatives.

When I refused to make a false statement about my colleague, the principal said ominously "Your contract renewal is coming up soon. You should think carefully about your future here." I interpreted this as a threat that I would face retaliation if I didn't cooperate.

A few months later, I was placed under investigation for alleged inappropriate conduct with students. The investigation focused on three main accusations: that I had given preferential treatment to certain students, used my personal phone to text students, and failed to properly document student meetings. While I admitted to occasionally using my phone to coordinate club activities, I maintained that the other allegations were false.

The school board ultimately terminated my employment, citing these policy violations. However, I believe the real reason was my refusal to provide false testimony during the racial discrimination investigation. I filed a First Amendment retaliation claim, arguing that my termination was punishment for exercising my right to refuse to make false statements about a matter of public concern.

The school district claims they had legitimate reasons to fire me based on the documented policy violations. They argue my termination had nothing to do with the discrimination investigation and that they would have taken the same action regardless of my refusal to provide the statement the principal requested.
