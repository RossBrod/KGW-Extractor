Based on the case text, I have identified the following causes of action:

<CYPHER>
CREATE (coa_1:CauseOfAction {name: "First Amendment Retaliation", type: "Constitutional Violation", description: "Retaliation for exercising free speech rights under the First Amendment"})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_1)
CREATE (coa_lb1:LegalBasis {name: "42 U.S.C. ยง 1983", type: "Federal Statute", description: "Civil action for deprivation of rights"})
MERGE (coa_1)-[:BASED_ON]->(coa_lb1)

CREATE (coa_2:CauseOfAction {name: "Discrimination", type: "FEHA Violation", description: "Discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act"})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_2)

CREATE (coa_3:CauseOfAction {name: "Retaliation", type: "FEHA Violation", description: "Retaliation in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act"})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_3)

CREATE (coa_4:CauseOfAction {name: "Violation of Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights", type: "Statutory Violation", description: "Violation of the California Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights"})
MERGE (case1)-[:ASSERTED_BY]->(coa_4)
</CYPHER>

The key causes of action are:

1. First Amendment Retaliation (under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983)
2. Discrimination in violation of California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA)
3. Retaliation in violation of FEHA
4. Violation of the California Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights

The plaintiff initially asserted six claims, but later dropped the harassment and California Constitution violation claims. The remaining four claims are the focus of this case.
