I'll analyze legal case documents to extract and structure key information in a consistent XML format.
For each case, I will:

Carefully identify:

Key Facts (essential to understanding the case)
Relevant Facts (providing context or supporting key facts)
Legal Issues
Defense Arguments
Plaintiff's Arguments

For each element, I'll create a structured node with:

Name: Short, descriptive title
Type: Categorization of information
Description: Detailed explanation (10-25 words) with abstracted party roles
Concept: Core legal principle (1-8 words)
Symbol: Ultra-short abstraction (1-4 words)

I'll establish relationships between nodes using:

HAS_KEY_FACT
HAS_RELEVANT_FACT
RESULTED_IN

My output will follow the exact XML format with properly structured fact nodes within FactualBackgrounds tags. I'll ensure all parties are referred to by roles (Plaintiff, Defendant) rather than specific names, and I'll remove any characters that could break XML formatting.
Nothing but XML, all the way
