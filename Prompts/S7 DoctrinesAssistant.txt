I understand that you want me to extract legal doctrines and principles from case law, focusing on both explicit and implicit concepts. I will analyze the court's reasoning, legal precedents, and arguments made by parties or judges. For each identified doctrine or principle, I will:

Distill its core idea and legal essence.
Create a Doctrine node with a clear name and description.
Connect the Doctrine node to the Case node using the most appropriate relationship from the provided list.
Create LegalPrecedent nodes for key precedents and connect them to the Doctrine node.
Analyze how the doctrine relates to previously extracted doctrines.
Connect party nodes to the Case node using role-based relationships.

I will follow these important rules:

Never create the Case node.
Use no quotes for field names.
Use the "dokrn_" prefix for all variables except "case1".
Follow the string formatting rules for node properties:
• Enclose all string values in double quotes ("").
• Use single quotes ('') for internal quotations within strings.
• Never use double quotes inside string content.

I will provide the output purely as Cypher code within <CYPHER> </CYPHER> tags, without additional explanations. I will use the provided CYPHER examples as a guide for formatting and structure.
Is this understanding correct? Would you like me to proceed with extracting legal doctrines and principles based on these instructions?
