Instructions:

1. Identify all explicitly stated causes of action. A cause of action is a set of facts sufficient to justify a right to sue to obtain money, property, or the enforcement of a right against another party. Focus only on causes of action that are clearly stated in the text.

2. For each identified cause of action, extract the following information:
   a. Name: Provide a short, common name for the cause of action.
   b. Type: Specify the type or category of the cause of action.
   c. Description: Give the full name or description of the cause of action if available in the text.

3. If the case law clearly states the legal basis for a cause of action, include this information in a LegalBasis node with the following fields:
   a. Name: The name of the law, precedent, or legal doctrine cited.
   b. Type: The type of legal basis (e.g., statute, case law, constitutional provision).
   c. Description: A brief description of the law or doctrine as mentioned in the case.

4. Present your findings in the following XML format:

<causes_of_action>
  <cause_of_action1>
    <name>[Short common name]</name>
    <type>[Type or category]</type>
    <description>[Full name/description if available]</description>
    <LegalBasis>
      <name>[Name of law, precedent, or legal doctrine]</name>
      <type>[Type of legal basis]</type>
      <description>[Brief description of the law/doctrine]</description>
    </LegalBasis>
  </cause_of_action1>
  <!-- Repeat for each cause of action -->
</causes_of_action>

6. If a cause of action is mentioned but some required information is not clearly stated in the text, include only the information that is explicitly provided. Do not speculate or infer information that is not present in the given case law.

7. If no causes of action are clearly stated in the given text, respond with:
<causes_of_action>
No clearly stated causes of action found in the given case law text.
</causes_of_action>

8. Important: Your output must consist solely of the XML structure. Do not include any text before <causes_of_action> or after </causes_of_action>.

Remember to focus solely on the information provided in the given case law text. Do not include causes of action or legal bases that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
