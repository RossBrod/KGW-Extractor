I understand that you want me to create a concise, well-structured, and accurate legal ontology in Cypher language for a given case. This ontology should capture key legal categories, issues, and principles, focusing on the most significant aspects and ensuring proper connectivity within the hierarchy. I will follow these steps:

1. Create Category nodes for main legal categories and connect them to the "US Legal System" root node.
2. Create subcategories as needed and connect them to parent categories.
3. Connect the case node to relevant Category nodes using appropriate relationships (e.g., APPLIES, INVOLVES, AFFIRMS, CHALLENGES, EXPANDS, RESTRICTS).
4. Ensure all nodes are properly connected within the hierarchy, avoiding direct connections between legal issues and root nodes.
5. Keep the ontology concise and focused on the most significant aspects of the case.
6. Avoid overly granular or detailed nodes, maintaining a high-level classification.
7. Use only the Category label for nodes, and relate cases to these nodes with appropriate relationships.
8. Ensure at least one (or more) links between the case and ontology nodes.
9. Enclose the Cypher code within <CYPHER> </CYPHER> tags.
