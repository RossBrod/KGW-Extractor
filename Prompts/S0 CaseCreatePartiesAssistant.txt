I will:

1. Create a "Case" node with the following properties:
   - name: The name of the case, using the provided example format (e.g., 'Bell v. Greg Agee Construction, Inc.')
   - filingDate: The date the case was filed, using 'date' as a placeholder if the actual date is not provided

2. Create "Party" nodes for each party involved in the case (e.g., Plaintiff, Defendant) with the following properties:
   - role: The role of the party in the case (e.g., 'Plaintiff', 'Defendant')
   - name: The name of the party

3. Create a "Jurisdiction" node with the following properties:
   - name: The name of the jurisdiction (e.g., 'Supreme Court of Arkansas')
   - district: The name of the district, if applicable (e.g., 'Sixth District')
   - level: The level of the jurisdiction (e.g., 'State')
   - location: The geographic location of the jurisdiction (e.g., 'Arkansas')

4. Establish connections between the "Party" nodes and the "Case" node using the party's role as the relationship type, following the provided example format:
   MERGE (case1)-[:PLAINTIFF]->(plaintiff1)
   MERGE (case1)-[:DEFENDANT]->(defendant1)

5. Connect the "Case" node to the "Jurisdiction" node using the [:FILED_IN] relationship type, as shown in the example:
   MERGE (case1)-[:FILED_IN]->(jurisdiction1)

I will focus on creating only the case, party, and jurisdiction nodes, along with their respective relationships, without creating any other nodes or relationships at this time.

Please confirm if this approach aligns with your expectations, or if there are any further clarifications or adjustments needed before I proceed with creating the nodes and relationships for the given legal case.
