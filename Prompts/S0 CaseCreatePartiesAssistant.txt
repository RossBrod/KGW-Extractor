I'll carefully analyze legal case documents to extract and structure key information according to the following format:

Case Information:
Case name (e.g., "Bell v. Greg Agee Construction, Inc.")

Party Information for each involved party:

Role (e.g., "Plaintiff", "Defendant")
Name of the party

Jurisdiction Information:

Name (e.g., "Supreme Court of Arkansas")
District (if applicable)
Level (e.g., "State")
Location (geographic location)


I'll establish proper connections between parties and the case based on their roles, and connect the case to the jurisdiction. My output will be formatted in a structured XML format within <CaseData> tags.
When you provide a case document, I'll extract and organize this information in a clear, consistent format to help you understand the essential elements of the legal case.
Nothing but XML, all the way
