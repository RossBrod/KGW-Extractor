I will provide two things:
1. An example case law summary followed by a short hint listing the key legal elements.
2. A new case law summary for you to analyze.

Your task is to generate a hint from the new case law summary, mimicking the style of the example hint. Distill the summary down to its core legal concepts and express them in a clear, non-bulleted comma separated list.

Please respond with only the generated hint, without any additional commentary.

Example of the  case law summary: 

"J.R. v. Elec. Arts is a case concerning a minor's disaffirmance of a contract with Electronic Arts (EA), the makers of the popular video game Apex Legends. The minor, J.R. II, filed a putative class action lawsuit against EA, alleging that the company deceptively induced players, particularly impressionable minors, to purchase digital game-specific currency to purchase cosmetic items and other features. EA moved to stay the action and compel arbitration based on the user agreement that J.R. II agreed to in order to play Apex Legends. However, J.R. II argued that he disaffirmed all of his contracts with EA, including the arbitration agreement, under Family Code section 6710.
Key Holdings and Legal Principles:
The main holding of the case is that a minor may disaffirm a contract, including an arbitration agreement, under Family Code section 6710. The court rejected EA's argument that an arbitrator should decide issues of arbitrability, including J.R. II's disaffirmance defense.
The court also discussed the importance of the delegation provision within the arbitration agreement, which provides that an arbitrator should decide gateway questions of arbitrability. However, the court found that the provision was ineffective because the contract was revocable under Family Code section 6710.
Both sides' arguments and reasoning:
EA argued that J.R. II had not successfully disaffirmed the user agreement and that the delegation provision within the arbitration agreement required an arbitrator to decide issues of arbitrability. J.R. II argued that he disaffirmed the entire user agreement, including the delegation provision, under Family Code section 6710.
Court's reasoning:
The court analyzed the case under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which embodies a liberal policy favoring arbitration. The court noted that the FAA operates on an additional, antecedent agreement to arbitrate gateway questions of arbitrability, such as whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agreement covers a particular controversy.
The court found that J.R. II unequivocally disaffirmed "any . . . contract or agreement" that he entered into with EA through his EA account. Therefore, there are no agreements between J.R. II and EA that J.R. II accepted through his EA account but has not disaffirmed.
Therefore, the court concluded that there is no arbitration agreement to enforce.
Legal principles or precedents:
The court relied on the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), Family Code section 6700 and 6710, and California case law on disaffirmance of contracts by minors.
This case establishes the legal principle that a minor may disaffirm a contract, including an arbitration agreement, under Family Code section 6710. It also highlights the importance of the delegation provision within the arbitration agreement and the court's role in assessing the validity of a minor's disaffirmance."
