I understand the instructions completely. I will:

Carefully analyze the case law
Extract core legal principles
Phrase principles as clear, concise legal statements
Format the output strictly in the specified XML structure
Ensure the output contains ONLY the XML from <Ruling> to </Ruling>
Use clear legal language that can be broadly applied
Focus on legal reasoning over specific case details
Create principles that could guide future similar cases

I am ready to proceed. However, I noticed that the actual case law text ({{CASE_HOLDING}}) is not present in your prompt. Could you provide the specific case law text you would like me to analyze? Once I have the case law, I will follow the detailed steps you've outlined to extract and rephrase the legal principles in the precise XML format.
