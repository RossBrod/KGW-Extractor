Please carefully read the provided case text : <case> @CaseText </case>

Then, 

Create a comprehensive legal hierarchy and relationship map for a specific case. I will provide a detailed summary of the case, including key facts, parties involved, and the core legal dispute or question at hand.

Once I provide the case summary, please:

1. Identify the primary legal issue(s) based on the information provided.
2. Categorize the primary issue(s) within the broader domains of law (e.g., Constitutional, Criminal, Civil, Administrative).
3. Break down the relevant legal domain(s) into subdomains and related legal concepts, as applicable to the specific case.
4. Present the legal hierarchy and relationships in the following format, ensuring that each term is wrapped in square brackets []:

Present the legal hierarchy and relationships in the following format, making sure to wrap each line in the specified tags:
<LawDomain>
[Broad Legal Domain] -> [Subdomains (if applicable)] -> [Specific Legal Issue or Concept]
...repeat as needed
</LawDomain>

Keep in mind that:
- A single case may involve multiple major legal categories, but your job to determine if multiple categories really define this case.
- Not every legal issue falls neatly into a single law domain category.
- Provide only the generated legal hierarchy and relationship map, without additional commentary.
