Extract structured and comprehensive representation of the lower court's decision, findings, key issues, and reasoning in the "Lower Court Findings, ruling or an opinion" portion of the case law file. Aim to capture this information and organize it into a graph database using Cypher nodes and relationships.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the "Lower Court Findings, ruling or an opinion" portion of the case law file and identify the following:
   a. Lower Court Decision: The main decision or ruling made by the lower court
   b. Lower Court Findings: The key findings or conclusions reached by the lower court
   c. Lower Court Issues: The main legal issues or questions addressed by the lower court
   d. Lower Court Reasoning: The reasoning or rationale behind the lower court's decision

2. For each identified piece of information, create a corresponding node with the following label and properties:
   - LowerCourtDecision: {name: "Short name", type: "Type", description: "Detailed description", concept: "Core legal or factual principle in 1-8 words. Avoid using specific names or details from the case.", symbol: "Ultra-short (1-4 words or less) abstraction of the decision. Avoid using specific names or details from the case."}
   - LowerCourtFinding: {name: "Short name", type: "Type", description: "Detailed description", concept: "Core legal or factual principle in 1-8 words. Avoid using specific names or details from the case.", symbol: "Ultra-short (1-4 words or less) abstraction of the finding. Avoid using specific names or details from the case."}
   - LowerCourtIssue: {name: "Short name", type: "Type", description: "Detailed description", concept: "Core legal or factual principle in 1-8 words. Avoid using specific names or details from the case.", symbol: "Ultra-short (1-4 words or less) abstraction of the issue. Avoid using specific names or details from the case."}
   - LowerCourtReasoning: {name: "Short name", type: "Type", description: "Detailed description", concept: "Core legal or factual principle in 1-8 words. Avoid using specific names or details from the case.", symbol: "Ultra-short (1-4 words or less) abstraction of the reasoning. Avoid using specific names or details from the case."}

   When creating the concept and symbol properties, refer to parties generically as "Plaintiff", "Defendant", or "Party" rather than using specific names.

3. Connect the nodes using the appropriate relationships:
   - [:HAS_LOWER_COURT_DECISION]: Connects the Case node (always use alias case1) to the LowerCourtDecision node
   - [:HAS_LOWER_COURT_FINDING]: Connects the Case node (case1) to the LowerCourtFinding nodes
   - [:HAS_LOWER_COURT_ISSUE]: Connects the Case node (case1) to the LowerCourtIssue nodes
   - [:HAS_REASONING]: Connects the LowerCourtDecision node to the LowerCourtReasoning nodes

4. Ensure that all nodes are properly connected to the Case node (case1), either directly or through intermediate nodes.

5. Review the created nodes and relationships to ensure they accurately represent the lower court's decision, findings, key issues, and reasoning in the case law file.

6. Limit the generated nodes to LowerCourtDecision, LowerCourtFinding, LowerCourtIssue, and LowerCourtReasoning. Do not include any other types of nodes.

7. Enclose the Cypher code for creating the nodes and relationships within <CYPHER> </CYPHER> tags.

IMPORTANT: 
1. When creating variables for nodes and relationships, it is critical to use the "dlct_" prefix for all variables EXCEPT for the "case1" variable which represents the case itself. Using a consistent prefix convention helps avoid naming conflicts and makes the Cypher code more readable and maintainable. The "dtrn_" prefix clearly indicates that a variable is part of the Cause of Action analysis.
Failure to use the proper "dlct_" prefix may result in errors or unexpected behavior when running the Cypher code. Always double check your variable names to ensure the "dtrn_" prefix is used appropriately.
2. When creating node properties, always use double quotes ("") to enclose string values. Inside the string content, particularly in description fields, use single quotes ('') for any quoted text or phrases. Never use double quotes inside the string content itself. For example: Correct: "This is a description with 'quoted text' inside it." Incorrect: "This is a description with "quoted text" inside it."
