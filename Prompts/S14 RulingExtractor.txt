Please carefully read the provided case text : <case> {{Case}} </case>
Then, 

Please follow these steps to extract and rephrase the ruling in legal principles:

1. Read the case holding carefully.
2. Identify the core legal issues addressed in the holding.
3. Extract the key legal reasoning and conclusions.
4. Separate general legal principles from case-specific facts or details.
5. Phrase each principle as a clear, standalone statement of law.
6. Ensure the principles are general enough to be potentially applicable to other similar cases.
7. Review and refine each principle to ensure it is well-defined and distinct from the others.

When phrasing the legal principles:
- Use clear, concise language
- AS if you start each principle with phrases like "The court held that..." or "It is established that..." but continue after that without those words
- Focus on the legal reasoning rather than specific facts of the case
- Avoid using names of specific parties or unique case details

Please  present your rephrased legal principles in the following format:
<Ruling>
<IssuesList>
   <issue1>[legal issues addressed in the holding]</issue1>
...continue as needed
<IssuesList>
<Holding>
<LP1>[First legal principle, maximum 15 words]</LP1>
<LP2>[Second legal principle, maximum 15 words]</LP2>
<LP3>[Third legal principle, maximum 15 words]</LP3>
...continue as needed
</Holding>
</Ruling>

Here's an example  of the desired output format (using generic content):
<Ruling>
<IssuesList>
   <issue1>[Whether agricultural laborers working under a "sharefarmer" agreement are independent contractors or employees under workers' compensation law]</issue1>
   <issue2>[How to properly apply the "control-of-work-details" test in modern employment contexts]</issue2>
...continue as needed
<IssuesList>
<Holding>
<LP1>The court held that [legal concept A] applies in cases involving [specific circumstance].</LP1>
<LP2>It is established that [legal principle B] must be considered when determining [legal issue].</LP2>
<LP3>The court ruled that [legal standard C] is the appropriate test for [legal situation].</LP3>
</Holding>
</Ruling>

Important:
1. Your output must consist solely of the XML structure. Do not include any text before <Ruling> or after </Ruling>.
2. Remember to focus on the key legal concepts and avoid including case-specific details unless they are crucial to understanding the legal principle. Your goal is to create a set of well-defined, distinct principles that could be applied in future cases dealing with similar legal issues.
