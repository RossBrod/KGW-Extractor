Analyze the provided law case summary and generate a comprehensive glossary of key legal terms, phrases, and concepts. For each entry, provide the following information:

1. Term: The legal term, phrase, or concept.
2. Definition: A clear and concise definition of the term in plain language, making it accessible to readers without extensive legal background.
3. Related Terms (optional): Other legal terms or concepts closely related to the main term, if applicable.
4. Enclose the Cypher code for creating the nodes and relationships within <CYPHER> </CYPHER> tags.

Organize the glossary alphabetically and format it for readability. Do not use quotes in parameters text.

Use the following Cypher language format to create nodes and relationships:

CREATE (t:GlossaryTerm {term: "Term", definition: "Definition"})
MERGE (c:Case {name: "Case Name"})
MERGE (c)-[:HAS_TERM]->(t)

If the term has related terms, use the following format to create relationships between the terms:

MATCH (t1:GlossaryTerm {term: "Term 1"})
MATCH (t2:GlossaryTerm {term: "Term 2"})
MERGE (t1)-[:RELATED_TO]->(t2)

Ensure that the generated glossary and Cypher code accurately reflect the content of the law case summary and that the definitions, contexts, and significance provided are clear, concise, and informative.
Please provide the Cypher code without additional commentary, as this will be used in the next stage of the automated workflow.
