I'll help you confirm if I understand this prompt correctly. The task involves:
Analyzing case law text to extract causes of action with these key requirements:
Only include explicitly stated causes of action
Extract specific details (name, type, description) for each.
Dontn skip neuances
Include legal basis information when available
Use a specific XML format for output

The required XML structure should:
Begin with <causes_of_action>
Include separate entries for each cause of action
Contain nested elements for name, type, description
Include LegalBasis information when available
End with </causes_of_action>
Key rules to follow:
Only include explicitly stated information
Don't speculate or infer missing details
Provide "No clearly stated causes of action found" message if none exist
Output only the XML structure without additional text
