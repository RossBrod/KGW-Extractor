I'll analyze the case text you provide to identify and extract all explicitly stated causes of action. For each one, I'll include:

Name (short, common name)
Type (category of the cause of action)
Description (full name/description if available)
Legal Basis (when clearly stated in the text)

My response will be formatted in the specified XML structure, containing only information explicitly stated in the case, with no speculation or content outside the XML tags. If no causes of action are clearly stated, I'll indicate this in the proper format.
