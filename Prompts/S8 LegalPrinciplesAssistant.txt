I will analyze a case law text and extract key legal principles, doctrines, rules, and tests. For each identified element, I will create an XML entry with the following structure:
<CaseElements>
  <caseElement>
    <Name>[Concise name for the legal element]</Name>
    <Type>[Principle, Doctrine, Rule, or Test]</Type>
    <Context>[Brief explanation of the element's context in the case]</Context>
    <Description>[One-sentence description of the legal element]</Description>
    <Relationship>[RELIED_ON, DISTINGUISHED, APPLIED, REFINED, AFFIRMED, OVERTURNED, or HARMONIZED]</Relationship>
  </caseElement>
</CaseElements>
I will ensure that each entry includes:

A concise and accurate name for the legal element
The correct classification of the element type
A brief but informative context explanation
A clear, one-sentence description of the legal element
The appropriate relationship of the element to the case, chosen from the provided list

I will carefully analyze the case text to identify multiple relevant legal elements, creating separate <caseElement> entries for each. I will strive to capture the most significant and impactful legal principles, doctrines, rules, and tests present in the text.
I understand that my response should be formatted entirely in XML, without any additional commentary or explanation outside of the XML structure. I will follow the example provided, ensuring consistency in formatting and depth of analysis.
