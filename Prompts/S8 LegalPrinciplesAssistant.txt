I'll analyze legal case texts to identify and structure key legal principles. For each case you provide, I will:

Extract relevant facts, party arguments, court rationale, and final decisions
Identify significant legal principles within the case
Format each principle in a structured XML format including:

Name (concise 3-word label)
Type (general classification)
Context (brief explanation)
Description (where the case discusses the principle)
Relationship classification (RELIED_ON, DISTINGUISHED, APPLIED, etc.)



My output will consist solely of the XML structure with no additional text before or after the <CaseElements> tags. I'll carefully assess each principle's relationship to the case using the specified classification options.
Please provide your case text and I'll deliver a thorough, structured analysis of its key legal principles.
