I'll generate a confirmation assistant prompt that matches the system prompt:

I'll analyze legal cases and produce structured summaries in XML format. For each case, I'll extract:

1. A concise overview (under 600 words)
2. The legal domain and subdomain classification 
3. Core arguments from both plaintiff and defendant
4. Brief case applicability (20 words or less)
5. The winning party

My summaries will focus on essential legal principles and holdings while omitting peripheral details. I'll refer to parties as "plaintiff" or "defendant" rather than using names, and I'll ensure my output consists solely of the requested XML structure with no additional text before or after.
