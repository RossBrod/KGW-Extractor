You are tasked with extracting a structured and comprehensive representation of key facts, relevant facts, legal issues, and arguments from a case law file. This task is crucial for creating a clear and organized understanding of complex legal cases. Follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:

First, carefully read and analyze the following case law file:

<case_law_file>
{{CASE_LAW_FILE}}
</case_law_file>

Now, follow these steps to extract and structure the information:

1. Analyze the case law file and identify the following elements:
   a. Key Facts: The most critical facts that are essential to understanding the case
   b. Relevant Facts: Additional facts that provide context or support the key facts


2. For each identified piece of information, create a corresponding node with the following properties:
   - name: A short, descriptive name for the fact, issue, or argument
   - type: The type of information (Key Facts, Relevant Facts, Legal Issues, Defense Argument, Plaintiff's Argument)
   - description: A detailed, neuanced(!!!) description of the fact with parties abstracted to roles (e.g., Plaintiff, Defendant) 10-25 words
   - concept: The core legal or factual principle in 1-8 words, avoiding specific names or details from the case
   - symbol: An ultra-short (1-4 words) abstraction of the fact, issue, or argument, avoiding specific names or details from the case

3. Connect the nodes using the appropriate relationships from the following list:
   - HAS_KEY_FACT: Connects the Case node to KeyFact nodes
   - HAS_RELEVANT_FACT: Connects the Case node to RelevantFact nodes
   - RESULTED_IN: Connects a Fact/Event/Procedure node to a subsequent Fact/Event/Procedure/Ruling/Judgement node

IMPORTANT: 
4. There can be only 1 Relationship attribute per <fact></fact> attribute
5. Present your findings in the following format:

<FactualBackgrounds>
<fact>
    <Type>[Type (Key Facts, Relevant Facts, Legal Issues, Defense Argument, Plaintiff's Argument)]</Type>
    <Name>[Short name]</Name>
    <Description>[Detailed description, with parties abstracted to roles, i.e., Plaintiff or Defendant]</Description>
    <Concept>[Core legal or factual principle in 1-8 words]</Concept>
    <Symbol>[Ultra-short (1-4 words) abstraction of fact]</Symbol>
    <Relationship>[Relationship name from the provided list]</Relationship>
</fact>
<!-- Repeat the <fact> element for each identified piece of information -->
</FactualBackgrounds>

Remember to:
- Be thorough and accurate in your analysis of the case law file
- Use clear and concise language in your descriptions
- Ensure that all parties are referred to by their roles (Plaintiff, Defendant) rather than specific names
- Choose appropriate relationships between nodes based on the provided list
- Double-check that your output follows the specified format exactly
- Remove all symbols that would brake XML from the values

Begin your analysis now and provide the structured representation of the case law file.
